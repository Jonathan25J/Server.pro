# Server.pro
A Minecraft plugin made to be used as Server.pro user to have no ads and have the opportunity to bypass the 10 plugins limit

This plugin creates an extra plugin folder(pluginz) to put some of the plugins there instead of the default plugin folder, to bypass the Server.pro 10 plugin limit.
It doesn't work with all plugins but with a few, like Essentials. If it doesn't work than put the plugin back to the default plugin folder!

The second thing that this plugin does is removing the ads that you sometimes get ingame, the important renew messages will stay but it's possible to change
that message in the config file. Reload the config with the /spreload command.
